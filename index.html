        <div class="Introduction">
            <p>This my Camelot Original Character Idea. Reference is of course, Jason, one
                of the Camelot Staffs and one of my Friends, I made this as a thanks for making
                Lria EX (it even won lmao), so Jason if you're reading this thank you and I hope you'll
                like this simple website I made, I use AI art since you don't send picture of yourself.
                for those who are reading this, don't expect too much as my skill in HTML, CSS, JS is not that good,
                and I don't have creativity skill (unfortunately). the reason why the AI looks like that is 
                because it's the closest looks similar to Jason according to some persons whom he met in Real Life,
                YES, I interview them to know more about Jason so I can make this OC. however take note that 
                this is just a reference.

            <div class="Story">
                <p><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason is a Criminology Student at X university, 
            and he doesn't like boba tea, his house has 
            a lot of gardening and flowers, he even has a little
            old-timey like Victorian style.<br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes girls
            and wants a girlfriend but
            he doesn't even have female friends because
            he is shy and awkward around them. He thought they were
            uncomfortable just being around him.... or at least that's what he thinks.
            In reality, girls think that he is very
            tidy and well-reserved, easy to get along
            with especially when talking about
            his hobbies which are animes.<br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time
            that he played Camelot, an anime collection discord
            bot where he whaled hard. During the time he was playing
            he liked bullying other players by dueling them (asking them
            for arena battles). Sooner the dev of Camelot started
            recruiting players to become helpers or mods. There he met
            a player that he got close with, this player later on sent a Cosplay
            Picture with his friend in an Anime Convention there.... started everything.
            Since then, Jason asked that friend for a new cosplay picture every day.
            This madness lasted for hundreds of days.
            Just like staying as a v*rgin at 30 years old to be a mage, Jason gained
            an Achievement for his unwavering commitment, his huge determination to get that
            cosplay picture. Because of this Achievement, he gained an ability
            perfect for his Assiduous Nature. Bro is down bad for a cosplay picture
            that he gained an ability to call a waifu to help him in any situation. However, Jason
            is too much of a simp for a waifu so he cannot hit any female
            or even a male if they crossdress as a waifu.
